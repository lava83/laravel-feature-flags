This package provides an opinionated API for implementing feature flags in your Laravel applications. It supports application-wide features as well as model specific feature flags.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require ryangjchandler/laravel-feature-flags
```

You should then publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="feature-flags-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="feature-flags-config"
```

## Usage

### Global flags

To enable or disable a global feature flag, you can use the `Features::enable()` and `Features::disable()` methods respectively.

```php
use RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Facades\Features;

Features::enable(name: 'registration');
Features::disable(name: 'registration');
```

To check if a flag is enabled or disabled, use the `Features::enabled()` and `Features::disabled()` methods respectively.

```php
use RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Facades\Features;

if (Features::enabled(name: 'registration')) {
    // `registration` is enabled.
}

if (Features::disabled(name: 'registration')) {
    // `registration` is disabled.
}
```

If you simply want to toggle a flag, you can use the `Features::toggle()` method.

```php
use RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Facades\Features;

Features::toggle(name: 'registration');
```

If the flag is enabled, it will be disabled. If it's disabled, it will be enabled.

### Model flags

If you would like to feature flag specific models, begin by implementing the `RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Models\Contracts\HasFeatures` interface and using the `RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Models\Concerns\WithFeatures` trait. Here's an example on a `User` model.

```php
use RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Models\Contracts\HasFeatures;
use RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Models\Concerns\Features;

class User extends Authenticatable implements HasFeatures
{
    use WithFeatures;
}
```

> The trait provides a default implementation that adheres to the interface. It's recommended that you always use this implementation instead of writing your own.

To enable, disable or toggle a flag, use the same `Features::enable()`, `Features::disable()` and `Features::toggle()` methods by providing a named argument `for`.

```php
use RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Facades\Features;

$user = User::first();

Features::enable('registration', for: $user);
Features::disable('registration', for: $user);
Features::toggle('registration', for: $user);
```

The `WithFeatures` trait also provides a few helper methods on the model: `enableFeature()`, `disableFeature()` and `toggleFeature()`.

### Blade directive

This package also provides a set of conditional Blade directives for protecting your views with feature flags.

```blade
@feature('registration')
    <a href="/register">Register now!</a>
@endfeature
```

You can use `@elsefeature` and `@unlessfeature` directives too.

If you would like to check a feature flag for a model, you can provide a named argument to the directive.

```php
return view('my-view', [
    'user' => User::first(),
]);
```

```blade
@feature('registration', for: $user)
    <a href="/register">Register now!</a>
@endfeature
```

### Middleware

This package provides a piece of middleware to protect your routes with feature flags.

You need to add the following code to your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'feature' => \RyanChandler\LaravelFeatureFlags\Middleware\HasFeature::class,
];
```

You can then register middleware on your route like so:

```php
Route::get('/register', fn () => ...)->middleware('feature:registration');
```

The default behaviour of the middleware is to abort with a `403 Forbidden` status code.

This can be configured in the configuration file by changing the value of `middleware.behaviour`. The package uses the `MiddlewareBehaviour` enumeration as the configuration value.

You can change the status code using the `middleware.code` configuration option.

#### Redirecting instead of aborting

If you would prefer to redirect instead of aborting, set `middleware.behaviour` to `MiddlewareBehaviour::Redirect` and `middleware.redirect` to your preferred redirect location.

#### Multiple features

If you wish, you may protect your routes behind multiple feature flags. You can do this by comma-separating the flags passed when defining the middleware on your route definition:

```php
Route::get('/feature', fn () => ...)->middleware('feature:verified,two-factor');
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
